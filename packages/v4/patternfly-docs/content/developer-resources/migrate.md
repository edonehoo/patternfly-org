PatternFly's latest major release introduces new support and functionality to PatternFly, including: 

- React 18 support, 
- Official dark theme support, and
- An enhanced system of versioned CSS classes and variables.

Note: Several components have been deprecated and will be removed at the next major release. Consumers will have a year to adopt our new recommendations before a deprecated component is removed.

### Milestone 1:
