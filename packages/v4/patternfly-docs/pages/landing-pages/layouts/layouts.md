# Layouts

PatternFlyâ€™s layouts are used to place components on a page. They create a fully responsive structure to keep components organized and aligned across screen sizes. 

Think of layouts as the scaffolding within which your components will live. When laying out your page, consider the layout pattern that suits your content. Multiple layouts can be used within the same page, as appropriate. 

PatternFly currently supports the following layouts:

## Bullseye
Bullseye layouts center content vertically and horizontally.

## Flex
