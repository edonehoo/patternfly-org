# Design foundations 

Our design foundations provide standards and guidance to help designers and developers work together more efficiently. They describe the visual language upon which all of our components are built. Our foundations lay the groundwork for clear and consistent product experiences.

## Colors 
PatternFly’s colors have been carefully selected to support flexible and effective visual communication. Our colors help us create more accessible and inclusive user experiences.
