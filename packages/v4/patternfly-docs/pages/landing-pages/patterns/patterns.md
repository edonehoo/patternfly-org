# Patterns
Patterns are reusable, best practices solutions that solve common user problems. They are complex and contain multiple components. To outline each pattern’s conventions, we provide design guidelines that describe a pattern’s usage, appearance, features, variations, and more. 

A pattern may also have related React or HTML demos that present interactive examples and general implementation code. These demos are contained in a tab separate from the design guidelines.

PatternFly currently supports the following patterns: 

## Bulk selection 
Bulk selection allows users to select or deselect multiple items in a content view.
