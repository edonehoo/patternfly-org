# Extensions 

Extensions are complex solutions that utilize multiple PatternFly components. They span products and platforms to drive consistent experiences across a user’s journey. 

There are two types of extensions: PatternFly extensions and community extensions.

## PatternFly extensions

PatternFly extensions are those that are released, tested, and fully supported by PatternFly. These extensions are typically designed for cross-project applications. 

PatternFly currently supports the following extensions:

### Catalog view 

A catalog view constructs an interface that is composed of different elements, like tiles, tabs, panels, and headers.

### Log viewer 

A log viewer enables you to clearly visualize your project's log content in real time.

### Quick starts

Quick starts contain two product documentation tools: quick starts and in-app documentation. These tools allow you to provide users guidance and documentation that is embedded within a product.

### React console

React console provides additional React components to enable access to virtual machines or server consoles.

### User feedback

User feedback enables products to collect asynchronous feedback from users.

## Community extensions

Community extensions are developed and maintained by members of the PatternFly community. While they are featured on PatternFly, they are not directly supported by the PatternFly team. The code and documentation for each community extension is hosted outside of PatternFly’s GitHub repositories. 

Occasionally a community extension may be promoted as an officially supported extension when its usage is proven across multiple projects and its value extends beyond project-specific use cases.
