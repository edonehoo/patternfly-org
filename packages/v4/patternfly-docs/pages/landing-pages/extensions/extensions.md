# Extensions 

Extensions are complex solutions that utilize multiple PatternFly components. They span products and platforms to drive consistent experiences across a user’s journey. 

There are two types of extensions: PatternFly extensions and community extensions.

## PatternFly extensions

PatternFly extensions are those that are released, tested, and fully supported by PatternFly. These extensions are typically designed for cross-project applications. 

PatternFly currently supports the  following extensions:

### Catalog view 


### Log viewer 

A log viewer is a preconfigured component that gives you the option to visualize your log content. Log viewer renders log output in real time in a clear and structured way.


### Quick starts
Quick starts is made up of two product documentation tools: quick starts and in-app documentation.

### React console


### User feedback



## Community extensions
Community extensions are developed and maintained by members of the PatternFly community. While they are featured on PatternFly, they are not directly supported by the PatternFly team. The code and documentation for each community extension is hosted outside of PatternFly’s GitHub repositories. 

Occasionally a community extension may be promoted as an officially supported extension if and when usage is proven across multiple projects and its value extends beyond project-specific use cases.
