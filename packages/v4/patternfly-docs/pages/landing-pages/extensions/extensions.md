# About 

Extensions are holistic solutions that utilize multiple PatternFly components, typically addressing cross-project use cases. They provide reusable code that can drive consistency throughout a userâ€™s journey across products and platforms. We welcome ideas and contributions for new extensions from the PatternFly community and will prioritize those that can be widely used by multiple projects.
