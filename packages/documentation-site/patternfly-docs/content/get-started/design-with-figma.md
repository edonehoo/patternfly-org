## Penta design kit

Our current design kit, "Penta", is available as part of PatternFly 6. In order to take advantage of Penta, you must upgrade to PatternFly 6. This also ensures that you'll have access to the most up-to-date resources and guidance! If you haven't yet, you can [follow our guide](/get-started/upgrade) to complete your upgrade. 

[Check out our frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions) for more details around PatternFly versioning.

### Get the design kit

To start designing with PatternFly, you will need to install the Penta design kit. The kit gives you full access to PatternFly's visual design system — including design tokens — so that you can create consistently usable product experiences. 

<div>
    <Button component="a" href='https://www.figma.com/@patternfly' target="_blank" variant='primary' size='lg' > Install Penta <ArrowRightIcon /> </Button>
    <br />
    <br />
</div>

If you have trouble getting the design kit, [review your access method](#1.-how-do-i-get-access-to-figma) or [reach out to us on Slack](http://join.slack.com/t/patternfly/shared_invite/zt-1npmqswgk-bF2R1E2rglV8jz5DNTezMQ).

## Frequently asked questions 

<br />

### 1. How do I get access to Figma?

#### I am a Red Hat employee

If you are a Red Hat employee on the User Experience Design (UXD) team, you will be added to the UXD workspace in Figma. This allows you to instantly receive library updates as they are made by the team. 

If you are a Red Hat employee, but you are not on the UXD team, you should work with your manager to be added to your team's respective workspace in Figma.

#### I am a PatternFly community member

If you are not a Red Hat employee, you will need to create a copy of the [Penta design file]() to install the library within your own Figma workspace. 

Note that you will not be able to receive automatic library updates since you are working from a local copy. The PatternFly team will release any updates every other week, as part of their sprint schedule. Be sure to revisit our Figma community page in order to download the latest updates. 

### 2. What if I haven't upgraded to PatternFly 6? 
If your product hasn't been upgraded to PatternFly 6, 

If you haven't migrated to Figma, continue to the next question.

### 3. What if I'm still using Sketch? 

Before PatternFly 5, the PatternFly design kit was available within Sketch. We have migrated our design libraries to Figma, in order to take advantage of its real-time collaboration features that help streamline the design process and support better communication. While you may still use Sketch if it best fits your needs, it is no longer our recommendation. [See more details within our Sketch instruction.](/get-started/design#sketch-design-kit)
