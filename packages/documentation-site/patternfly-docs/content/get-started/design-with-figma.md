## Penta design kit

Penta is part of PatternFly 6, so you will need to be fully upgraded in order to use the Penta kit. We recommend upgrading to PatternFly 6 to ensure that you're getting the most up-to-date resources and guidance. If you haven't yet, you can [follow our guide](/get-started/upgrade) to complete your upgrade. 

If you're still using PatternFly 5, [view our separate guidance](#patternfly-5-design-library). 

### Get the design kit

To start designing with PatternFly, you will need to install our design kit, called **"Penta"**. Our [Penta kit](https://www.figma.com/@patternfly) gives you full access to PatternFly's visual design system — including design tokens — so that you can create consistently usable product experiences. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <Button component="a" href='https://www.figma.com/@patternfly' target="_blank" variant='primary' size='lg' > Install Penta <ArrowRightIcon /> </Button>
    <br />
    <br />
</div>


If you have trouble getting the design kit, [refer to these steps](#1.-how-do-i-get-access-to-figma), or reach out to us on Slack.

### What is in the Penta design kit? 

In the Penta design kit, you will have access to a few things: 
- A component library 
- A design token system 
- Template files and/or demos if we add

#### The component library 

Our component library contains [all PatternFly components](/components/all-components)

#### Design tokens

For information on how to use design tokens, [visit our tokens documentation](/tokens/about-tokens).

### Where do I start?

Once you've installed Penta, you're ready to start designing beautiful products. 

If you're completely new to PatternFly, we suggest that you [get familiar with our design system](/get-started/about-patternfly) first!

## Frequently asked questions 

<br />

### 1. How do I get access to Figma?

#### I am a Red Hat employee

If you are a Red Hat employee on the User Experience Design (UXD) team, you will be added to the UXD workspace in Figma. This allows you to instantly receive library updates as they are made by the team. 

If you are a Red Hat employee, but you are not on the UXD team, you should work with your manager to be added to your team's respective workspace in Figma.

#### I am a PatternFly community member

If you are not a Red Hat employee, you will need to create a copy of the [Penta design file]() to install the library within your own Figma workspace. 

Note that you will not be able to receive automatic library updates since you are working from a local copy. The PatternFly team will release any updates every other week, as part of their sprint schedule. Be sure to revisit our Figma community page in order to download the latest updates. 

### 2. What happened to the PatternFly 5 design library? 

Before PatternFly 5, the PatternFly design kit was available within Sketch. We have migrated our design libraries to Figma, in order to take advantage of its real-time collaboration features that help streamline the design process and support better communication. While you may still use Sketch if it best fits your needs, it is no longer our recommendation. [See more details within our Sketch instruction.](/get-started/design#sketch-design-kit)
