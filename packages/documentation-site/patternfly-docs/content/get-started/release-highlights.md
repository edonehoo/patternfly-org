## PatternFly 6 alpha

We're excited to announce that our alpha release of PatternFly 6 is now live. Here are the highlights that you should know about!

### Penta

As you've probably already noticed on the alpha website: PatternFly has a new look. Our brand new visual theme is called "Penta". Its visual style is more modern and refined, so that you you can create UIs that are more seamless and lightweight.

All of our components have a new look to match. As you explore the alpha website, take a look at our component examples, demos, and patterns, to check out all the differences.

### Design tokens 

In order to support Penta, and any future visual theming capabilities, we have implemented a design token system for PatternFly. For more details and instructions on how to use tokens, you can refer to our [design token documentation.](/tokens/about-tokens)

Our tokens cover both dark and light themes, and make it easier to support both in your product.

**Note:** The PatternFly 5 design library is not built with tokens. To take advantage of our token system, you must upgrade your product to PatternFly 6 and its Penta theme.
