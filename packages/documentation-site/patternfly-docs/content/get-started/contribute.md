## Community contributions 

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PatternFly! We depend on community contributions to help our design system grow and evolve. We encourage everyone, regardless of background, to get involved with. Common contributions include: 
- New feature ideas 
- Bug reports
- Documentation updates

With your help, we can stay on top of the latest and greatest solutions to make PatternFly the best open source design system for UI. 

## Design

The PatternFly design team is composed of a small, but mighty group of visual and interaction designers who define the visual look and feel of the PatternFly library. They also provide direction to developers as they implement new features and enhancements in a product's codebase. The team follows an agile framework, planning their work in sprints in the [patternfly-design GitHub repository](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/issues)

As a designer, your skills and knowledge in visual and interaction design are well suited for the following types of contributions. If you are interested in contributing to any of these projects, reach out to us on the [patternfly-design channel on Slack](http://join.slack.com/t/patternfly/shared_invite/zt-1npmqswgk-bF2R1E2rglV8jz5DNTezMQ).

### New feature or enhancement
If you have an idea for a new design pattern, a new component type, or have ideas for improving existing features, you can work with our design team to design

open a new issue  if you'd like to propose a design.

he design backlog is tracked and managed via [this GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/patternfly/projects/7/views/30), which contains issues that are currently unassigned and waiting in the queue. You can claim one of these issues or 


### Figma kit

### New icons
We encourage designers to work with the existing PatternFly icon set when choosing icons to use in their project. These include both custom and existing Font Awesome icons that cover most common use cases. To see what's available, vist our [Icons page](/design-foundations/icons). However, there may be occasions where you want to propose a new icon to be added to PatternFly.

__Example__
*I want to add a new custom icon to PatternFly to meet my project specific need.*

To contribute a new icon, start by opening an issue in the [patternfly-design](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/issues) repo proposing a new icon and why it's needed. Then, follow the procedure outlined here for [creating custom icons](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/wiki/Creating-custom-icons) and adding them to the PatternFly icon set.

### Existing GitHub issues 

To learn about existing projects that have been approved, but not started, you can view open issues in both our [HTML](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues) and [React](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues) GitHub repositories. If you find an issue that you're interested in working on, leave a comment and someone from our team will reach out to you with next steps. 

Be sure to view our detailed contribution instructions for both of these repositories:
- [HTML/CSS contribution guidelines](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly#guidelines-for-css-development)
- [React contribution guidelines](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-process)

### File a bug
  - View the documentation for the component
  - Search open issues in the [patternfly](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues) and [patternfly-react](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues) repos to see if a related issue exists already
  - If the bug is present in only the React implementation, create a bug in the [patternfly-react repo](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues)
  - If the bug can be seen on both the React and HTML/CSS side, it should be created on the [patternfly repo](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues)
  - Mention which project the bug was noticed in and if there is a deadline that the fix is needed for

## Documentation 

Our website documentation is contained in the [patternfly-org repository](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org).

If you'd like to contribute to our documentation, you can refer to our [detailed contribution instructions](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org/wiki/Contributing-to-patternfly-org-for-designers) for additional guidance.

### Design guidelines
Across our website you will find design guidelines, which help designers add PatternFly components to their designs following best practice UI patterns. These guidelines clarify nuances and outline  design conventions that should be followed when using a component, layout, or chart. 

If you'd like to contribute to our design guidelines, you can open an issue in our [patternfly-org repository](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org) to propose a new page or updates to an existing page. From there, our team will work with you to author and publish your new content.
