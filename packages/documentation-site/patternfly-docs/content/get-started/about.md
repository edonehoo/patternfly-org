## What is PatternFly? 

PatternFly is an open source design system that enables designers and developers to create consistent and usable software products. 

A **design system** is a collection of software design standards and resources that enable its users to design more consistently and productively. When you design and develop with a design system, you can reduce redundancy and enable a unified language between cross-functional teams. This means that products will be visually consistent, and will use patterns that support better usability and efficiency.

The PatternFly design system is created and maintained by Red Hat, and is used across Red Hat's product catalog, but it's open for anyone to use. Across our website, we provide code samples, clear standards, guidance, and additional resources that help designers and developers work together more efficiently and build better user experiences.

## What does PatternFly include?

The PatternFly design system is robust and expansive, but the features you will use the most can be grouped into a few general categories. 

### Foundations

PatternFly's foundations include the visual elements that create the basis for the rest of the design system.

## How do I stay up to date?

<Grid hasGutter>
<GridItem span={6} >
We plan to release a new major version of PatternFly every year. These major releases will be the only releases with 
planned "breaking" changes that alter core code functionality. Along with each major release, we will provide thorough upgrade guides and codemods to support the work needed to upgrade your products to the latest version of PatternFly.
</GridItem>

<GridItem span={6} >
Minor feature releases will be available quarterly to introduce non-breaking changes, like new features and enhancements, with interim on-demand releases to fix bugs.
</GridItem>

</Grid>

<br />

## How can I request a new feature?

PatternFly is built on the needs of our community. To request a new feature or an enhancement to an existing feature, [open a new discussion topic in the PatternFly feature request discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/patternfly/discussions/categories/feature-requests). The PatternFly team will review and prioritize your issue, taking into account scope and technical constraints. If accepted, your feature request will be placed on the [PatternFly feature roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/patternfly/projects/16), and the PatternFly design team will work with you to design and develop a solution for your request.

Flexibility
PatternFly was built to be flexible and is scoped to work in tandem with other design systems. This means youâ€™re able to use PatternFly components alongside components from systems like Bootstrap, Material.io, or older versions of PatternFly.

For example, our code is written like pf-v5-c-alert
