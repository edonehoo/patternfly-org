We invite developers of all skill levels to contribute code to PatternFly, either to advance our system with new features or to fix issues in our existing offerings.

## Where do I start?

A great way to get familiar with our team and processes is to [attend our biweekly office hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=patternflyteam%40gmail.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York). You can listen in on discussions, get help with a problem, or sign up for a time to chat with the team.

When you're ready to contribute, the best place to start is by finding a "good first issue" in one of our repos.

## Find a good first issue 

"Good first issues" are tasks our team has identified as being well-suited for new community members. You can find these in our component repositories:

- [patternfly (Core):](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Good%20first%20issue%22) Our foundational HTML/CSS library. [View the Core contribution guidelines.](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly#guidelines-for-css-development)
- [patternfly-react:](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Good%20first%20issue%22) Our React library. [View the React contribution guidelines.](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-process)

If you find an issue you'd like to work on, leave a comment and a team member will guide you. For questions, you can reach out on the [#patternfly-core](https://patternfly.slack.com/archives/C9Q224EFL) or [#patternfly-react](https://patternfly.slack.com/archives/C4FM977N0) Slack channels.
