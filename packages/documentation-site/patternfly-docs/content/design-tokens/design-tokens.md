# Design tokens 

## What are design tokens

Design tokens are variables that store visual design attributes, like color, typography, and spacing. A design token has a name and value that represents the visual design information it contains. 



## Why use tokens 

Using design tokens helps maintain consistency across product design processes by ensuring that designers use the same colors for the same use cases. 

Tokens also allow for easier maintenance design updates. If a color changes as part of a redesign or update, developers won't have to make any changes to code. Any time a token is changed, it will update automatically and apply to all instances of use.

## How to read tokens
