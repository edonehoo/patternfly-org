# Design tokens 

## What are design tokens

Design tokens are variables that store visual design attributes, like color, typography, and spacing. A design token has a name and value that represents the visual design information it contains.

### Token layers 

![Design layers example](./img/design-layers-example.png)

#### Palette layer 

Just the color palettes 

same idea as current color paletter variables

#### Base layer 

“Palette” of tokens that the semantic layer can choose from
Grouped conceptually, named numerically
No duplicates within token concept groups

### Semantic layer

Top level tokens that we know and love
Grouped conceptually, named semantically
Reference base tokens, but can also reference other semantic tokens
