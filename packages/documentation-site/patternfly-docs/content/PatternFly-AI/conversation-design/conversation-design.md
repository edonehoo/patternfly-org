# What is conversation design?

**Conversation design** is method of writing for conversational interfaces, like chatbots or voicebots. The goal of conversation design is to create an interactive experience that resembles human-to-human conversation as much as possible. Like traditional content design, conversation design is focused on using words to make experiences clear, concise, and well-timed.

It is important to align conversation design with the established [PatternFly brand voice and tone](/ux-writing/brand-voice-and-tone), as well as the [PatternFly AI guidelines](/patternfly-ai/ai-guidelines) and [principles.](/ai/about-ai)

## What do conversation designers do? 

Conversation designers are the people who design what goes into the conversational interface. Often coming from the field of UX, they combine content strategy, writing, and design to ensure that the development and use of chatbots is centered on real user needs. They work on all text related to the conversational UI, including prompts, replies, and buttons.

Conversation designers must work across all phases of design:

| **Design phases** | **Goal** | **Common tasks** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strategy | Create a strategy based on user goals, expectations, and desires that were identified through research. | <ul><li>Develop an understanding of users through existing research, personas, and interviews.</li><br /><li>Decide on the chatbot's personality, voice, and tone.</li><br /><li>Outline the paths that a user could take in a chatbot conversation, and the consequences of veering off a path.</li></ul> |     
| Writing and design | Based on the strategy decided, write all necessary content, including microcopy, dialogs, and prompts. | <ul><li>Plan and outline all possible conversation flows.</li><br /><li>Write content for the welcome and opt-in message, button text, global help and stop requests, and re-engagement prompts.</li></ul> |
| Prototyping and testing | Create a working prototype, test it, and iterate as needed.| <ul><li>Use a prototyping software to build the chatbot flows.</li><br /><li>Manually test the bot to identify any points of friction or error.</li><br /><li>Assess the effectiveness of the chatbot.</li></ul>

## Best practices 

Following these best practices will help ensure that your users can complete their goals through a conversation with AI. 

- Reference your chatbot's goal in your opening message. Keep it the focus throughout the conversation.
- Establish conversation patterns and stick to them. 
- Be clear. Keep it short and simple. Aim to write 3 lines of text or less within a single message, and send no more than 3 messages before allowing users to provide input. 
- Be direct. Limit choices for users as much as possible and provide examples when you can.
- Avoid open ended questions. If you ask any, make them very simple, increase pause time between messages, and tell users when they should type. 
- Unlike traditional content design, *don't lead with the benefit.* End with the benefit to be sure that its read and acted upon. Users should be able to complete an action solely based on a chatbot's last sentence. 
- Frame questions in terms of value for the user.
- If you ask for personal info, tell users "why" you're asking first. 
- Always have the last word.
