The **stack** layout positions items vertically, with one item filling the available vertical space.

## Elements

[image]

1. **stack**: the stack container
1. **stack item**: the stack child

The stack layout does not wrap, because flex-direction is set to column and is not modifiable. 

## Usage


## Variations

You can apply gutters to adjust spacing between items.

You can modify an item's fill to allow a split-item to grow with available space. Multiple items can be set to fill. [link to example] Setting a fill to multiple items does not constrain their width. These items will grow as their content dictates needed space.
