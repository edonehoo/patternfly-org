1. **Split**: The split container, which holds all split items.
1. **Split item**: An individual section of content to be placed in the split layout.

## Usage
Use the split layout when content should be flexible and may change dynamically. 

## Variations

### Multiple items that fill space 

You can specify which split item fills the remaining container space. More than one item can be set to fill and they will share the remaining space equally.

### Items that wrap 

You can wrap a split item to ensure that it properly fits alongside other content as the screen is resized.

### Gutters around items

To adjust spacing between items, you can apply gutters.
