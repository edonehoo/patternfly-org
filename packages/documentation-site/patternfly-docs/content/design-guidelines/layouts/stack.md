1. **Stack**: The stack container, which holds all stack items.
1. **Stack item**: An individual section of content to be placed in the stack. 

## Usage

### When to use stack vs other layouts 

The stack layout does not wrap. If you need a layout that wraps, instead choose the flex, gallery, level, or split layout instead.

## Variations

### Multiple items that fill space 

You can specifiy which stack item fill the remaining vertical space in the layout. More than one items can be set to fill, and they will share the remaining space equally.
