The **bullseye** layout centers content, both vertically and horizontally within a container.

## Elements 

<img src="./img/bullseye-example.png"  alt="PatternFly website screenshot showing modal created with bullseye layout."  width="3330px"/>

1. **Bullseye:** The bullseye container, which contains the bullseye child item
2. **Bullseye item:** The bullseye child, which contains the section of content you want to be centered 

## Usage 

A bullseye layout can only contain one section of content. For example,  bullseye layout is commonly used with [modal components](/components/modal), to overlay important content on top of another layout, like a gallery of cards.

If you need to center multiple sections of content on a page, you should choose a different PatternFly layout.
