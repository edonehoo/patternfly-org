The **gallery** layout is used to arrange content in a responsive grid. Content will wrap responsively to create uniform rows and columns.

## Elements

The gallery layout is designed so that all of its elements are of uniform size, display horizontally, and wrap responsively.

## Variations

Gutters can be applied to increase the spacing of gallery items.

Both a minimum and maximum width can be defined for gallery items. These values determine the width that a gallery item is allowed to be before they wrap.
