The **flex** layout supports a completely custom layout by utilizing the PatternFly spacer and breakpoint systems. Flex layouts are infinitely nestable and allow you to adjust spacing, direction, alignment, justification, wrapping, and width to fit your needs.

## Elements

1. **Flex item:** the grid child

## Usage

Flex layouts can be combined with other layouts to create versatile UIs.

### When to use 

Use the flex layout when for content heavy UIs and when it is necessary to wrap UI elements.

### When to use the flex layout vs the grid layout
Also use the flex layout when a rigid grid is not necessary or wanted.

## Variations

The flex layout is based on the [CSS "flex" properties](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex.php), which help determine how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its container.
