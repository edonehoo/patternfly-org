# What is conversation design?

**Conversation design** is a subset of user experience design, focused on the design of conversation between humans and technology, most often through chatbots or voicebots. The goal of conversation design is to create an interactive experience that resembles human-to-human conversation as much as possible. 

It is important to align conversation design with the established [PatternFly brand voice and tone](/ux-writing/brand-voice-and-tone), as well as our [AI guidelines](/ai/ai-guidelines) and [principles.](/ai/about-ai)

## What do conversation designers do? 

Often coming from the field of UX, **conversation designers** combine technical and writing skills with the fundamentals of user-centered design to ensure that the development and use of chatbots is centered on real user needs. They work on all text related to the conversational UI, including prompts, replies, and buttons.

Conversation designers may work across a few design phases, including:

- **Strategy:** Based on goals, expectations, and desires of users. 
    Outline the paths that a user could take in a chatbot conversation, as well as the consequences of veering off a path. 

**Writing and design:** 
- 

**Prototyping, testing, and training:**
- 


## Best practices 

- Remember your goal. Reference it in your opening and keep it the focus.
- Be clear. Keep it short and simple. Try to stick to 3 lines of text in a message bot. Send 1 to 3 messages before allowing a user to provide input. Don't add fluff. 
- Get creative with features available, cards, quick reply buttons, 
- Avoid open ended questions. If you ask any, make them very simple, increase pause time between messages, and tell users when they should type.
- Don't lead with the benefit. This is different than traditional content design, but its important to end with the benefit, so that we're sure its read and acted upon. Users should be able to complete an action solely based on the last sentence. 
-  If you ask for personal info, put the "why" before the ask. 
- Frame questions in terms of value for the user.
- Provide examples when you can. 
- Be direct
- Limit choices for users.
- Establish patterns. 
- Always have the last word.
