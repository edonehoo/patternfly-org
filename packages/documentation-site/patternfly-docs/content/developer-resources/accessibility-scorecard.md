## Scoring your accessibility

To support the proper assessment of accessibility measures, we've created a scorecard that outlines the ways that we recommend testing for accessibility and how well your UI meets those expectations. You can use this scorecard as a guide to evaluate the state of accessibility for any UI built using PatternFly.

## PatternFly.org accessibility scorecard

The following scorecard demonstrates what a completed scorecard may look like for your product. This information can help you communicate the accessibility of your product by clearly identifying how it meets important criteria.

Note that this example scorecard assesses the documentation on PatternFly.org. 

If you're a developer looking for more guidance on conducting an accessibility audit, refer to our [accessibility testing guide](/accessibility/testing-your-accessibility).
