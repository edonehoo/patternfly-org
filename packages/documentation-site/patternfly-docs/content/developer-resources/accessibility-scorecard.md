## Scoring your accessibility

To support the proper assessment of accessibility measures, we've created a scorecard that outlines the ways that we recommend testing your UI and assessing how well it meets accessibility expectations. A completed scorecard can help you communicate the accessibility of your UI to stakeholders by clearly identifying how it meets important criteria.

If you're a developer looking for more detailed guidance on conducting an accessibility audit, refer to our [accessibility testing guide](/accessibility/testing-your-accessibility).

## PatternFly.org accessibility scorecard

The following example demonstrates what a completed scorecard may look like by assessing the PatternFly.org website documentation.
