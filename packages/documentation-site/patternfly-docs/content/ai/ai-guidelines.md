## Principles

How we design is as important as what we design
How do AI experiences impact people in a desired or undesired way?

IBM’s AI ethics framework offers a foundation for ensuring our AI systems meet ethical standards, and are user-centered. The key areas include:

### Accountable 

Ensure clear responsibilities are defined for AI designs, development and deployment. This includes policies and docs of design decisions and processes​.
    - Accessibility: Make company policies on AI ethics and accountability readily accessible to all team members from the start.
    - Transparency: Document our design processes and decision-making to help users understand the hows and the whys..
    - Legal compliance: Ensure we are following laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines throughout the AI development process.

### Explainable
Strive for AI systems that are transparent and comprehensible, allowing users to understand how decisions are made, and who’s making it.
    - Transparency: Design AI systems whose decision-making processes can be understood by all users.
    - User Understanding: Provide clear explanations of how AI systems reach their conclusions, making it easier for users to trust and interact with them. 

### Fair and trustworthy
Focus on creating AI systems that do not amplify bias
    - Bias Mitigation: Identify and mitigate biases in AI systems to prevent discriminatory outcomes.
    - Inclusive Design: Ensure that AI systems are designed to be inclusive, accommodating various user demographics and avoiding systemic bias.
    - Fair Access: Provide equal access to AI technologies, ensuring they are available and beneficial to most users and communities.

    Emphasize human-centered AI design that focuses on accessibility, transparency, and user empowerment. Integrate these principles to enhance user trust and engagement​

### User-centered

#### User Data Rights
Safeguard user privacy and data rights, ensuring users have control over their data and how it is used by AI systems​.
    - Privacy Protection: Safeguard user data and ensure that PII is protected and used responsibly.
    - User Control: Give users control over their data, including the ability to access, modify, and delete their information from AI systems.
    - Data Transparency: Be transparent about how user data is collected, stored, and used, and obtain informed consent for its use in AI systems.

#### Value Alignment
Align AI system with user outcomes. This includes continuously refining systems based on user feedback and ethical considerations.
    - User needs: Design AI systems to align with the values and needs of users.
    - Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of and respect cultural differences and ensure AI systems are inclusive and respectful of diverse perspectives.

## Guidelines 

When designing with AI, keep the following guidelines in mind.

### Focus on user needs 

Like with UX, make sure that your users are the center of focus

1. Determine if AI adds value 

1. Be transparent 

1. What to do when something goes wrong 

### Enhance human ability

AI should enhance human ability: not replace it.

1. Avoid silos 

1. Check for accuracy
